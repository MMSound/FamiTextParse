This is a small utility that parses a FamiTracker (or other fork) .txt file into an organized .json file. This could possibly be used for making conversions of FT modules to other formats.

Everything important is in the "FTTextParse" script; the rest of the project is not necessary to use.

Included in the datafiles folder are three example .txt files: recreations of the soundtracks of Hokuto no Ken (1987, FC), Sword Master (FC, 1990), and covers of "Troia Base - Passage" and "Troia Base - Forwarding" from Mega Man X8 (PS2, 2004).

Not currently tested with expansion chips, though it should work properly.
